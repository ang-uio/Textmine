title: "Tokens in Context: Concordance Lists"
questions:
- "What is a concordance list?"
- "How can a concordance list be created for a particular search term?"
objectives:
- "Understand what a concordance list is."
- "Learn how to create one."
keypoints:
- "A concordance list is a list of all contexts in which a particular token appears in a corpus or text."
- "A concordance list can be created using the ``concordance()``` method of the ```Text``` class in NLTK."

## Concordance Analysis or Keywords in Context (KWIC)

Next, we will display concordances for a particular token, i.e. all contexts a particular token appears in. We can do this by first importing the ```Text``` class, a wrapper which supports exploration and analysis through a variety of analyses, including by concordancing. See full description of ```Text``` class functionality at [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.text.Text.html). The concordance list of a token is displayed using the ```concordance()``` method as shown below.

```python
from nltk.text import Text
t = Text(lower_india_tokens)
t.concordance('woman')
```

 In the output for the next bit of code which creates a concordance list for the word "he", we can see that there are many more results in the list than displayed on screen (```Displaying 25 of 170 matches```). The ```concordance()``` method only prints the first 25 results by default (or less if there are less).

```python
t = Text(lower_india_tokens)
t.concordance('he')
