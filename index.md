## Introduction to Text Mining

[What is text mining?](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/)

"Text Mining is the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources... The difference between regular data mining and text mining is that in text mining the patterns are extracted from natural language text rather than from structured databases of facts." - [from What is Text Mining?](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/text-mining.html) by [Marti Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marti_Hearst)

[Types of text mining and digital analysis of text](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/text-mining-types.html)

[Tools and software bundles for text mining](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/tools-software-bundles.html)

Text mining requires data - a note on the value of platforms such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [DH-Lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/).

Quick look at DH-Lab Tools and [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) - option to revert to these during the course.

Learning a programming language is like learning any new language. It requires copying, repeating, using a dictionary, practicing, learning enough of the ‘grammar’ of the language to detect typos and mistakes.

- Learn how to look things up ([textbooks](https://www.nltk.org/book/), [online resources](https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/2eb10ab6787d032e317ce883fb0bc3427406333d/ipynb/Useful%20Resources.ipynb), [published tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?topic=python), [forums](https://stackoverflow.com/)).

> Learning goals: 
> 
> Get a sense of how the Python program works (the math behind it with strings and loops etc.).
> 
> Get a feel for how Python code can be used to text mine.
